\title{A method to plot and/or return the predicted tail factors for a specific attachment point.}
\description{A method to plot and/or return the predicted tail factors for a specific attachment point.}
\details{The tail factor is the ratio of the estimated ultimate loss to cumulative loss at some point in development time.
This is a method to allow for the retrieval and illustration of the tail factor by exposure year.

Because the model is Bayesian, each tail factor comes as a distribution.  To ease graphical interpretation, only the median for each factor is plotted/returned.
See for more details \code{\link{tailFactor}}.}
\value{Mainly called for the side effect of plotting.  Also returns tail factors for \emph{all} attachment points through \code{finalAttachment}.  Returned invisibly.}

\arguments{\item{object}{The object from which to plot the predicted tail factors and return tail factors for \emph{all} attachment points.}
\item{attachment}{An integer value specifying the attachment point for the tail.  Must be at least 1. See Details for more info.}
\item{useObservedValues}{A logical value.  If \code{TRUE}, observed values are substituted for predicted values whenever possible in the calculation.  If \code{FALSE}, only predicted values are used.}
\item{firstIsHalfReport}{A logical value or \code{NA}.  See Details for more information.}
\item{finalAttachment}{An integer value must be at least 1 default value is \code{attachment}.  A call to \code{tailFactor} returns (invisibly) a matrix of tail factors through this value.}
\item{plot}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, the plot is generated and the statistics are returned; otherwise only the statistics are returned.}
\item{expYearRange}{Either a range of years (for example c(1995, 2006)) or one of the keywords \dQuote{all} or \dQuote{fullyObs}.}}
